You can import results from NMAP into the MSF database.

Nmap <ip> -oX Target_1 (This will output the result to a xml file called Target_1)
service postgresql start
msfconsole
db_status (shows our database status)
**First you should create a new workspace before importing results**
workspace -a Windows_Target
workspace (checks active workspace)
db_import /root/Target_1
hosts (shows you your target)
services (shows you the targets services from the nmap scan)
vulns (This will list out the current vulnerabilities if any are found)

It is possible to initiate an NMAP scan from within the metasploit database and save those results to that workspace
We will see how to do this in a fresh workspace
workspace -a NMAP_MSF_EXAMPLE

db_nmap -Pn -sV -O <IP> (The results from this will be automatically imported to the workspace, the same as if you had imported the results)
vulns (This will list out the current vulnerabilities if any are found)
