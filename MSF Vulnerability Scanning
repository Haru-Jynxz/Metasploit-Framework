metasploit db_autopwn is a good tool for bruteforcing exploits on each
open port.

-PI will target a specific port

MSF also has a command used when you have database info called
analyze
vulns

Its also more stealthy and practical to use searchsploit or msf search exploit
to find openings based off service versions and aux scanner results etc
