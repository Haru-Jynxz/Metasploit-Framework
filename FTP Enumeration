service postgresql start
workspace -a FTP_ENUM
search portscan
use 6
**Port scan just to get info on target**
auxiliary/scanner/ftp/ftp_version (good first one to use against FTP)
**Now with the version you can find any exploits if there are any**
auxiliary/scanner/ftp/ftp_login (good brute force option)
user/pass file are found in /usr/share/metasploit-framework/data/wordlists/common_users.txt and /unix_passwords.txt
**With any creds you can use FTP withing MSFconsole**
ftp <ip> (if the service is down just give it a bit, with bruteforce it can sometimes dos the service)
auxiliary/scanner/ftp/anonymous (anon login scanner)
**This will show nothing if its not vulnerable**
